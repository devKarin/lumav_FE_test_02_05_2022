# lumav_FE_test_02_05_2022

Initially the application was a test assignment for the company Lumav Commerce OÜ regarding a frontend developer position in May 2022.

It has been developed further and migrated from a plain React.js application into a Next.js application.

In the future this project will be integrated into a larger project of mine and it may not be available as a standalone application.

## Assignment description summary (in English)

Create a React app, which consists of a form, a grid for products, and a counter for products in the shopping cart. <br/>

Through the form the products can be added to the product grid. Form fields consist of a product image, a product name, and a product price field. <br/>

When submitted, the product with data given through form will be added into the grid. <br />

One product consists of an image, a name, and a price. Additionally, it has to have an "Add to cart" button and a button to remove the product from the grid.
Clicking the removal button, the product will be deleted from the grid. When added to the cart, the product count in the cart must change accordingly.<br/>

Do not use any frameworks for the design (e.g., Bootstrap, Material UI, etc.) - the design must be self-made.<br />

## Assignment description summary (original, in Estonian)

Tee Reacti app, mis koosneb vormist, toodete gridist ja ostukorvis olevate toodete counterist. <br/>

Vormi kaudu saab lisada tooteid toodete gridi. Vormi väljades on toote pilt, nimi ja hind. <br/>

Vormi submittimise peale lisatakse vormis määratud andmetega toode toodete gridi. <br/>

Üks toode koosneb pildist, nimest ja hinnast, peale nende peab tootel olema “lisa ostukorvi” nupp ja gridist eemaldamise nupp.
Gridist eemaldamise nupule vajutades kustutatakse vastav toode gridist. Toodet ostukorvi lisades peab muutuma ostukorvis olevate toodete arv vastavalt. <br/>

Ära kasuta kujunduse jaoks eraldi frameworki (nt Bootstrap, Material UI jms) - kujundus peab olema ise tehtud.
